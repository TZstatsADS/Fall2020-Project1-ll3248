### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2020

+ Projec title: Project 1: History on Repeat? Is 2020 looking like 2016?
+ This project is conducted by Levi Lee

+ Project summary: It is very tempting to dismiss the upcoming 2020 election as a repeat of the 2016 election. Indeed, many have already. However, this project utilizes data from the American National Election Studies (ANES)'s 2016 and 2018 pilot studies to describe how they are actually very different. By analyzing events such as COVID-19 and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, we actually see--with data!--that 2020's election will be far different from what one might expect. We end with a discussion about different types of biases that may not only affect the sampled data but our analyses as well.
