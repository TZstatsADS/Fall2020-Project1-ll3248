### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. 
This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. 
Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

	anes_pilot_2016.sav: 2016 ANES pilot study dataset
	anes_pilot_2020ets_sav.SAV: 2016 ANES pilot study dataset
